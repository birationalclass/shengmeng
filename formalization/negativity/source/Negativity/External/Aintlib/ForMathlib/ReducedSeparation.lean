# Field-valued points separate elements of a reduced ring

In a reduced commutative ring, an element vanishing under every ring hom to a field is
zero (`IsReduced.eq_zero_of_forall_ringHom_field`), so two elements agreeing under every
ring hom to a field are equal (`IsReduced.eq_of_forall_ringHom_field`): the intersection
of the primes is the nilradical, and each prime is realised as the kernel of the map to
the fraction field of its quotient.

This is the reduce-to-geometric-points step of KM 1.9.2 ("in order that `P₁,…,P_N` form
a full set of sections … it suffices to check after base change to every residue
field"), applied there over `MvPolynomial (Fin n) R` — whose reducedness for reduced `R`
mathlib already has.

Note the family must range over homs into fields realising every *prime* (fraction
fields of quotient domains); maximal-residue fields alone would only detect the Jacobson
radical, which exceeds the nilradical in general.

Upstream candidate: mathlib has `nilpotent_iff_mem_prime` and the
`IsReduced (MvPolynomial σ R)` instance, but not this separation statement.
